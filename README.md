# Martian Day May 28 2020 - React

This is the repository for the Martian Day presentation.

## Presentation contents

- Overview of a react application
- Different types of state: state, props, and effects
- Local state with hooks
- Effects with hooks
- API with effects
- Global state with hooks (authorization)
- Questions

## What I want for the future

I'd like to have a [Marsbased React style guide](/docs/REACT_STYLE_GUIDE.md) and a reference implementation: [client/](/client)

The React style guide is based on what David, Genís and I did in the last Zerg Rush.

My proposal is to start with the content of this repository as a base, and open PRs to make changes, additions, etc.

We can have several reference implementations in different branches. One more standard in `master`, and possible variations (`akita`: state with Akita)

## Contributing

Node required.

Clone this repo and run setup the project:

```bash
npm run setup
```

To start (api and client): `npm run start`

Make a PR.
